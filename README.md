# devops-monitoring

In this project I will be setting up a web application on an ec2 image and monitoring it using Grafana, Prometheus and Alert Manager as a part of the DevOps Monitoring Deep Dive course on A Cloud Guru



1. I created a terraform script to quickly deploy my ec2 instance along with installing and setting up docker.

2. I then clone the example application ``https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-devops-monitoring-app``
